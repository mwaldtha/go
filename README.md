go
=========

A coding exercise for an interview.

This repository includes the source code (including unit tests) for a Go project.

It can be built and tested using go from the command line. For example:

To create an executable (in the bin directory) from the `src/github.com/mwaldtha/pwdsrv` directory:

    go install


To run the tests from the `src/github.com/mwaldtha/pwdsrv` directory:

    go test
or

    go test -test.v

To execute the built server from the `bin` directory (and specify a port):

    pwdsrv -port 8888

Once you have a running server, you can issue requests to the following endpoints:

    POST /hash/
        with a form field named "password"
    GET /hash/{job_id}

    GET /stats/

For instance, given the request (generated by curl)

    curl --data "password=angryMonkey" http://localhost:8080

The server will return
