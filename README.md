go
=========

A coding exercise for an interview.

This repository includes the source code (including unit tests) for a Go project.

When launched it monitors a given port (or default 8080) and waits for http connections.
When a connection is made it does not respond immediately, but rather it holds the socket open for 5 seconds and then responds.
It supports POST requests containing a value that the client wishes to be hashed.
The hashing algorithm is SHA512
The result is returned base64 encoded
The server can process multiple connections simultaneously.

For instance, given the request (generated by curl)

curl --data "password=angryMonkey" http://localhost:8080

The server will return

It can be built and tested using go from the command line. For example:

To build:
    
    go build


To run the tests:
    
    go test

To execute a built server:
   
   pwdsrv.exe -port 8080
